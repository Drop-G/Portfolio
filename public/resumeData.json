    "skillmessage":"Here are some of my skills, I want to be clear with who is reading this right now. I have years of experience in kitchens filling complicated roles on the line. Because of the pandemic the restaurant industry has taken a serious dive and I found myself unsure of what to do next. Mid 2020, over the summer I decided that because I love computers and proplem solving that I would commit to learning full stack web development. I had experience with building some functions and command line interfaces with python or javascript and node.js. Now I have a more broad skillset, having been exposed and worked with languages like HTML5, CSS, SCSS, XML, ReactJS, NodeJS, JQuery, Javascript, MySQL, MongoDB, and I some experience with Swift.",

Whenever I need a breathe of fresh air or to get out of my head I like to go hiking, skateboarding, painting, or if I can cook a nice meal for friends and family I would definitely choose that over all else.",

    "skillmessage":" I want to be clear with who is reading this right now about my experience in the tech industry. I have years of experience in kitchens filling complicated roles on the line. Now, because of the pandemic the restaurant industry has taken a serious dive and I immediatly started brainstorming solutions. So because I love computers and problem solving that I decided to commit to learning full stack web development. Theres still so much to discover, but nso far I have built functioning applications with languages like HTML5, CSS, SCSS, XML, ReactJS, NodeJS, JQuery, Javascript, MySQL, MongoDB, and I some experience with Swift.",
